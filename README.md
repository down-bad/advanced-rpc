# AdvancedRPC for Cider

This plugin allows you to configure the Cider Rich Presence to your likings, such as adding custom buttons, showing different info while pausing, or even changing the Client ID.

**You need to disable Cider's built-in Discord RPC in order to use this plugin, as they are completely separate.**

To access the settings, click the Cider icon on the top bar, click the "Plug-in" option to access your installed plugins and select the "AdvancedRPC" option.
