## FAQ

### Why do I have to disable Cider's Rich Presence to use the plugin?

AdvancedRPC and Cider's RPC are completely separate and thus it is not possible to use both at the same time in order to avoid having 2 presences. AdvancedRPC will remain disabled until you turn off Cider's RPC.

### Can I switch back to Cider's RPC without uninstalling the plugin?

Yes, simply enable Cider's RPC and AdvancedRPC will automatically disable itself.

### I don't get the "Listening to Cider" role on Cider's Discord server while using this plugin

This is because the default Client ID that comes with the plugin is different from the ones that Cider use. You can change the Client ID from the advanced settings.
